Hi aneeqah. I just wanted to take a moment to reflect on the last 3 years that we've spent together, i know that we've had many ups and downs, mostly because of my behaviour and i know it hasn't been easy. But i'm seriously thankful to you. I'm thankful that even on our worst days you continue to choose me. Even when things seem impossible and everything is compelling us to give up, i'm thankful that you choose me despite all of that. I know that i've done many shitty things, but i hope that one day, i can do so many things like this that those things will become irrelevant. I'm so happy to be the one you love, i'm so lucky to have such a sweet caring smart and beautiful girl who loves me more than anything. I promise that i will always strive to be better than what i am today. I will become the man of your dreams, and i will do everything in my power to make sure you're always smiling. I love you so much aneeqah. Forever yours. Qasim.
